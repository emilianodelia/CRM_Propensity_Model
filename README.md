# CRM_Propensity_Model

## __Case Description__:
* Payments are a fundamental source of information for the bank as well as a critical source of revenue and recurring business
* For a bank, holding a transactional relationship with its customers is critical, payments are the core component of a primary banking relationship which allow broadening the relationship towards other types products
* POS becomes a powerful tool to ensure a strong relationship with our SMEs customers, and they also become a powerful source of information and other services for SMEs
* The CRM team adds value in the sales-process by fine-tuning the selection of customers that our salesforce must address at the time of having a commercial conversation
* Given our salesforce has limited capacity to manage customer conversations, prioritising contacts in terms of expected return or success is critical

## __Objective:__
* Role-play as a Data Analyst of a CRM team and help our salesforce identify those customers with the highest propensity to sign-up for a POS with us
* In order to do this, a Data-set based on real data from real SMEs (anonymised and sanitised to ensure privacy) was provided
* The final output should be a model that will help the salesforce identify those customers in which they should prioritise their commercial activity in the following weeks to maximise the no of sales
